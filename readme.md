This a component based approach to a panzoom widget. It is completely vanilla except for morphdom, which is used to render dom updates.

To run the project locally:

`yarn install`

Then

`yarn build`

Now the project cant be viewed at `localhost:8080`

You can substitute `npm run` for `yarn` if youre old school. The working project can also be viewed here(befitting-cakes.surge.sh)
